# parse-server-docker
Simple docker image for parse-server

As you might now Parse (parse.com) decided to wind down their services beginning today (January 28, 2016). To make things easier for the community, they published an open source version of their actual servers which can be run and maintained locally.

If you are willing to continue to use Parse APIâ€™s in your applications, you will need to run that Parse Server on your server.

You can reach the repository of the Parse Server from here: https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server

This Docker File helps you to install & run Parse Server on your server in just seconds.
